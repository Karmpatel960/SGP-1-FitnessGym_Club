/**
 * An important note in regards to typing timeout timers. There are two places that the SDK can get the "typing_timeout" attribute from. The first
 * place that the attribute appears in is the response received from POST -> /v1/typing REST call. In the body of that response, the value of the
 * "typing_timeout" attribute will be exactly the same as defined in the console. The second place that the attribute appears in is from a
 * notification of type "twilio.ipmsg.typing_indicator". In this case, the "typing_timeout" value will be +1 of that in the console. This
 * intentional. The timeout returned from the POST -> /v1/typing call should be used to disable further calls for that period of time. On contrary,
 * the timeout returned from the notification should be used as the timeout for the "typingEnded" event, +1 is to account for latency.
